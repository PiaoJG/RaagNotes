# RaagNotes

Raag Notes lets you create notation sets for Indian Classical musical compositions using an intuitive interface.

- Save and view notations of a bandish (composition)

- Reference the notations for raags found in Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji (complete set of raags coming soon)

The Raag Notes project would like to acknowledge the following community initiatives for their efforts in helping to make the gurmat sangeet tradition more accessible. The app makes use of some of this publicly accessible data:

- Jawaddi Taksal (jawadditaksal.org)
- VSK Labs (Vikram Singh Khalsa)
- Gurmat Sangeet Project (gurmatsangeetproject.com)
